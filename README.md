# Fraud-Detection
## Introduction
I found an interesting dataset on Kaggle and thought it was perfect to work on as a small personal endeavour.<br>
The dataset contains a set of highly unbalanced instances of credit card fraud. I had never dealt with such skewed data and thought it was just the right thing to help me progress.<br>
## Goal
To create a model which hopefully isn't overfitted and doesn't classify almost all cases as non-fraudulent.<br>
A plus point would be if it has good accuracy and is practical enough that a bank or credit card company can think of using the same type of model.
